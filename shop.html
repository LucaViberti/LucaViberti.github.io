    <p>This store is refreshed weekly for the first part and daily for the second one.</p>
    <p>The purple stars are available from the purchase of the daily special pack or, just a few, from some events like the arms race.</p>
    <p>For f2p -> you can accumulate your star points to buy the Legendary Promotion Stone.</p>
    <p>Medium/low spenders -> you can also buy the Soul for your main queue</p>
    <p>High spenders -> best choice is to buy all the Legendary Promotion Stone every time and as many Soul stones as possible.</p>
    <p>In any case, here stay focused on weekly refresh items, the daily refresh can be very good if you are a high spender but for f2p is useless.</p>

    <h2>VIP</h2>
    <p>This store is refreshed weekly.</p>
    <p>It is based on your VIP level, once reached VIP 10, all the items will be available.</p>
    <p>What to buy every week:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relic scroll</li>
      <li>Pet food</li>
      <li>Universal speed-ups</li>
      <li>Stamina</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The other things are very expensive so buy that just if you have a lot of diamonds and you need that item for some reason.</p>

    <h2>Daily</h2>
    <p>This store is refreshed daily.</p>
    <p>It is based on your VIP level, once reached VIP 10, all the items will be available.</p>
    <p>What to buy first every day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Premium carriage voucher</li>
      <li>Shard</li>
      <li>Token</li>
      <li>Pet food</li>
      <li>Stamina</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you can, you can also buy the meat and Gear enhance runce but it requires a high VIP level and many diamonds every day.</p>
    <p>The other things are very expensive so buy that just if you have a lot of diamonds and you need that item for some reason.</p>

    <h2>Relics</h2>
    <p>This store is refreshed weekly.</p>
    <p>Once your relic is at the max of the stars, you can trade it.</p>
    <p>You can do that without any problems; all the shards can be used in different ways. Check the Relics tips in order to decide where to invest your shards.</p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>This store is refreshed daily for the first part and weekly for the second one.</p>
    <p>You will lack meat the whole game. So we recommend to trade wood and stone to get more meat.</p>
    <p>Weekly you can trade some items based on the traits unlocked by your guild.</p>
    <p>You can trade here when you need to, but pay attention to the deal; especially the last line of items is very expensive.</p>
    <p>This store can be a weapon during Guild Race and some other events; trade just when you need to, and just during those kinds of events.</p>

    <h2>Season Store</h2>
    <p>At the moment the best choice is saving all your points; as soon as we’ll have more information on how to spend the points in the best way, we will update this page.</p>
